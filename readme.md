# Backend project
The project will involve Javascript, Express, Node.js, mongodb, mongoose. 
I have created a social network. This includes posts, users, comments, likes, unlikes, follows and followers.


## Description

### It is expected that the student develops a REST API that is capable of the following:
* User registration using Bcrypt.
* User login + token + middleware.
* That is capable of creating a CRUD.
* Give + take away "Like" a post.
* Backend available in production (Heroku).


### Essential requirements of the project:
* Use of branches with git, when the project is finished there should be two branches, the master or main and the develop.
* Excellent README presentation.

### Technologies used
* Javascript
* Express
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

For the development of the API we will use MongoDB with Mongoose and express.
The project will be uploaded to a public GitHub repository and the
existence of branches, as well as several commits of high readable quality for
analyze the evolution of the project.
